# Repository Work Plan

## 1. Inventory
- `backend/`: Django 5 + DRF, applications under `apps/*`, shared config, and management scripts.
- `frontend/`: React 19 + Vite + TypeScript; focus on `src/`, `public/`, and configuration (`eslint`, `tailwind`, `vite`).
- `scripts/`: import and backup helpers that need clearer typing and documentation.
- Documentation (`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, etc.) must describe actual commands, environment variables, and duties.

## 2. Common tasks
- Identify sections lacking annotations and add typing so `mypy` and IDEs understand contracts.
- Update instructions for running/testing backend, frontend, docker, CI/CD, and backups.
- Record which tests or checks apply to each area (e.g., `python manage.py test`, `npm run lint`).
